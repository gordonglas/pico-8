# Cart snippets

This folder contains simple carts that demonstrate something. Cart files have a `.p8` extension, but can be viewed in plain-text to see it's lua code, or can be loaded into [Pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php).

* [4x4-wizard-anim.p8](4x4-wizard-anim.p8) has two larger wizard sprites that are made up of 4 sprites each, and has code that animates them.
